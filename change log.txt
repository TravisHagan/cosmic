1. RTS1996 case file was added:
	Based off the MatPower version
	Branch rate B was added as the midpoint between A and C
	Generators were grouped into one unit
	Governor values were found to crash Cosmic:
		Ti - integrator time constant (from Ki) was set to 4 from default of 0 to match case 39
		LCmax and LCmin were changed from default of (+/-)10 to (+/-)100
	
2.	A generic rts96 simulation file was created. It is based on the example cases.
	
3. Resuming from a state was added as an additional feature:
	This does not change the program calls and only allows for the feature
	Added:
		load_sim_state.m
		save_sim_state.m
	Modified:
		psoptions.m - Added new option: opt.sim.resuming_sim
		simgrid.m - function allows for x and y state variables to be inserted as a starting point, user does not need to provide these to use non resuming case

4. Adding a rollout load shedding policy
